/**
 * The guard against a malformed `record_work` call corrupting a note.
 *
 * Observed for real: a call arrived whose `summary` ended with a closing tag and
 * then carried the whole `changes` array as literal text. It was written
 * verbatim, so the changes section never rendered and nobody noticed until the
 * raw tags showed up in Obsidian days later. Silent vault corruption is the
 * failure being closed here, and every automated signal reported success while
 * it happened.
